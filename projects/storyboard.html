    <p>My project is obviously about the negative effects of fast fashion that I hope to combat, as I would like to imbue the user with a sense of conscientiousness.</p>
    <p>With the first draft, my partner thought that that it should be made more clear as to how the app is used, and from my consultation with him, I decided that it will be a web app, and that the data would already be stored in the app, and you'd be able
      to pull the stats for the brand off of the website. </p>
    <p>With the second one, my partner thought it was significantly more cohesive than my first draft, and that it was a good cause I was lending my technological prowess to.</p>
    <p>I care a lot about the ethics surrounding my clothing, so I thought it was appropriate to use evocative imagery (as evocative as you can get with stick figures), just because the cause is truly so worthy. Fast fashion damages the earth, the workers, and the psyche, and there should be more people made aware of this plague.</p>
