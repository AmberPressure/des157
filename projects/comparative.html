        <p>Upon inspection of the Geena Davis institute for gender in media page, I was perplexed by a bit of the UI. I suppose one of the more prevalent issues I have with the site is the horrific color scheme, as it features possibly the ugliest radial
          gradient ever, which does not play well with the deep fuchsia and mulberry tones featured in the nav bar.</p>
        <p>That being said, the site is responsive, and it has a nice use of CSS rules on their divs, but I would have liked it if there was more affirmation from the site regarding where I was hovering my cursor. I also would prefer that they would put
          their logo in more places instead of their logotype, as it seriously weakens the overall page for its quality.</p>
        <p>On the page where the new stories are located, for some reason, the page just ends instead of continuing on into a different set of stories, it just stops at the end of the page, leaving an uncomfortable amount of space between the footer and
          the end of the body of the page, which, I would declare to be an easy fix.</p>
        <p>Another issue I have with the end of the page is that there is not a button that allows me to go back to the top of the page with a reference #. Instead, I have to scroll all the way up to the nav bar. This would not be such a big issue to me
          if the nav was sticky, and followed the scroll of the page instead.</p>
        <p>The banner is a nice addition, but it does not allow me to click on any of the content on the page that is featured the most prominently, which I find really puzzling. Like, if you do not want me to click on it, why is it even on display? The
          graphic design choices are already strange enough, why would you make an album of terribly designed pieces that I cannot even access for the actual content?</p>
        <p>At the top right of the page, there are social media links as well as a donate button, but none of the buttons are styled with a hover or a click function, so it leaves the user wondering if they had pressed it at all. I would also love it if
          there was more of a user friendly sense all in all, just because I think it is pretty frustrating as a UI designer and an audience member to not receive affirmation for hovering, clicking, and other options.</p>

        <p>After reviewing the Geena Davis site, the AWIS page was truly a site for sore eyes. The color scheme is united, with a calming analogous blueish theme, along with an orange accent wherever the page wanted you to put some sort of form or input
          in. </p>
        <p>The footer of the page included a logo, contact information, quick links that could be found in the main nav bar, but were placed there for ease of situation. They also had responsive quick links and a social media bar for easy access. A toggle
          button came out of the right side for ease of navigation that interacted with my cursor and led to the top of the page. </p>
        <p>The very top nav bar also had drop down menus that allowed for easier access of the page with the about us part featuring a brief arrow. One of my critiques here would be that for some reason the member login text in the aforementioned nav is
          not orange, as that would continue the overall theme of the input text. Any push towards a sense of brand unity would be ideal, ever since it is pre established. </p>
        <p>Another arbitrary issue I have with the site is that for some reason, on the banner, there is an arrow that reacts to a cursor hover, but it has no function at all when it comes to clicking on the item itself. Additionally, for some reason, right
          under banner, there is a div with links, and they put what should be the
          <!--fig caption-->under the linked div, which makes no sense at all to me. </p>
        <p>The site serves its function as a proper landing page, especially with such in-depth nav bars, that total completely to 4 nav bars, which normally, out of context, I would consider desperately unnecessary, but here, I find that the form and function
          operate very well under each other. </p>
