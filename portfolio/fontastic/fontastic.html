  <h1>Fontastic: A Web Comic Depicting the Plights of a Young Web Developer</h1>

  <article>
    <p>As someone with only a moderate amount of relevant experience in the world of web design, I find that it tends to often be tricky to find a way in.</p>
    <p>This series of web-comics is meant to relate to the struggles of your garden variety web developer, whether it be the art of typography changing a website for the better, or even how having conflicting skills can be confusing for a young professional.</p>
    <p>That being said, I hope you enjoy this peek into the world of web design, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me <a href="mailto:ambkumar@ucdavis.edu">via email</a>. Hope you have a great day!</p>
