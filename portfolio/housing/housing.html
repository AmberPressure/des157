    <p>1. Come one, come all to the Winter Ball! Dress in semi-formal attire to catch the eye of someone you admire! Admission is free, so pick up your wristbands from your respective Area Service desk before they're gone! </p>
    <p>2. On February 28th, we bring the cuisines of the world right to your local dining commons. Be sure to not miss this one-time event!</p>
    <p>3. We only have one home- there's no Planet B. Do your part and participate in Student Housing's Upcycling Events, conveniently located at an Area Service location near you! </p>
